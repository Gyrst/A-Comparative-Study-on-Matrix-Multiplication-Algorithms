# A-Comparative-Study-on-Matrix-Multiplication-Algorithms
Matrix multiplication is the mathematical operation of multiplying two matrices. It is a fundamental linear algebra tool that is applied in several domains. This code project presents different algorithms to solve matrix multiplication of square matrices with side lengths defined as n = 2^x, with x > 0. In particular, we present and run experiments to compare the performance measured in time of six different matrix multiplication algorithms (see appendix A.3.2 for reference in the paper written for this project). This project was made for the Applied Algorithms Exam report. All implementations of the algorithms are written using C-Python.
